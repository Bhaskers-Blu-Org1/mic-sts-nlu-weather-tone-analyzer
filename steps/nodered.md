### Important Notes that are needed for the nodes in Node-RED editor:

* Each service will automatically create its credentials: `Username` and `Password`
* If you don't see the service credentials, you can create a new one: `Create Credentials`
* Internet of Things Platform will require to create an `api key` and `api token`. There's an how-to guide included on [IoT page](https://github.com/hovig/mic-sts-nlu-weather-tone-analyzer/blob/master/steps/iot.md#how-to).
